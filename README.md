## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository!

Iâ€™m a backend engineer with a strong focus on building efficient, scalable, and maintainable services using Python and Flask. This repository is a collection of personal projects, experiments, and tools that reflect my interest in modern backend development, particularly with serverless architectures and cloud-native solutions.

Flask is my framework of choice for quickly building RESTful APIs and microservices. Its lightweight and flexible design allows me to structure applications cleanly while staying in control of every aspect of the request/response cycle. I enjoy creating services that are easy to understand, well-documented, and built with performance in mind.

I also work extensively with AWS Lambda to create serverless applications that scale automatically and reduce infrastructure overhead. By combining Flask with serverless deployment strategies, I aim to build cost-effective systems that are both fast and resilient. My experience includes integrating other AWS services such as API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, and CloudWatch to create fully managed, event-driven architectures.

This repository features a mix of backend projects, serverless API examples, automation scripts, and boilerplate templates. I focus on clean code, modular design, and best practices around error handling, logging, and security.

Whether you're exploring serverless development, building Python-based backends, or looking to improve your cloud workflow, I hope the projects here offer something valuable. Each one reflects a practical problem or concept that Iâ€™ve explored and documented for others to learn from or build upon.

Feel free to dive into the code, fork a project, or reach out with questions or ideas. Iâ€™m always open to feedback, collaboration, and connecting with fellow developers in the backend and cloud space.

Thanks for visiting, and enjoy exploring the repository!
